# To Do List

## Description

This is a To-Do-List that lets you track multiple items, mark them as completed and delete them from the list. I created a box to scroll infinitely in case you have 100's of to do's hanging over your head. They are stored in a database for long term storage.

## Prerequisites

Node.js
Postgresql
Express.js
JQuery
Bodyparser

Need NPM so you can install dependencies.

## Usage

Input your task and submit it. You can mark it as complete or delete it.
